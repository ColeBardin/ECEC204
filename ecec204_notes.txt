Each Port Px where x is an integer, is a struct containing 5 uint8_t:

struct *Px {
	uint8_t DIR; /* Direction index of bits-> 1 for outputs for Px.index */
	uint8_t OUT; /* If dir is OUT, then it produces output */
	uint8_t IN;  /* If dir is IN, then there is an input number */
	uint8_t REN; /* Pull up/down, 1 for index makes Px.index active high, 0 for low */
	uint8_t SEL; /* */
};

PINS: Px.y where x.y is a float. x being the port and y being the index
Two build in LEDS:
LED1 -> red (P1.0)
LED2 -> r|g|b (P2.0 red, P2.1 green, P2.2 blue)

Switches:
S1 P1.1
S2 P1.4


Enabling Ports/Pins with Operands:
P6->DIR |= 0b10000000; /* Enables P6.7 without affecting other pins */
P6->DIR ^= 0b10000000; /* Toggles P6.7 without affecting other pins */
P6->DIR &= 0b10000000; /* Keeps P6.7 status while setting all other pins to off */

&= with 1 OR |= with 0 keeps status of other pins


Serial Communication:
UART: Universal Asynchronous Rx Tx
